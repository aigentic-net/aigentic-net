I build **virtual white-collar teams** -- autonomous inference systems that do the work of analysts, researchers, and coordinators, then hand humans the results with receipts.

**Founder of [Aigentic](https://www.aigentic.net)** -- institutional-grade AI research infrastructure where machines accelerate discovery and humans make decisions.

### What I'm building

**Aigentic** ships human-supervised AI systems that replace headcount-heavy knowledge work with orchestrated inference pipelines. Not chatbots. Not copilots. Full workflow execution that moves numbers on a P&L.

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Inference Circuits** | Modular agentic pipelines -- each "team member" is a purpose-built reasoning chain with tool access, memory, and accountability |
| **Looped Reasoning** | Iterative transformer architectures that trade parameters for compute loops, getting more out of smaller models |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Oversight** | Every output is auditable. AI proposes, domain experts dispose. No black-box decisions reaching production |

### The thesis

Most AI companies sell acceleration. I sell **replacement of entire workflows** -- with measurable ROI, not vibes.

- Virtual analyst teams that run 24/7 research pipelines across financial, legal, and scientific domains
- Deliberately guided inference -- not "prompt and pray," but structured reasoning with verification gates
- Quantifiable gains to the bottom line: fewer FTEs on repetitive knowledge work, faster time-to-insight, auditable outputs

### Technical focus

- **Agentic orchestration** -- multi-agent systems with tool use, persistent memory, and self-correction loops
- **Looped language models** -- challenging scaling laws by injecting iterative reasoning into inference rather than adding parameters
- **Knowledge manipulation** -- moving beyond retrieval (memorization) toward genuine reasoning over domain knowledge
- **Production inference engineering** -- making research-grade ideas run reliably at scale with human oversight

### Philosophy

From the [Aigentic](https://www.aigentic.net) charter:

> *Human intelligence, amplified. The future of research lies not in replacing human expertise, but in augmenting it with advanced AI capabilities that accelerate discovery and enhance understanding.*

The bottleneck in most organizations isn't compute -- it's the gap between what AI can theoretically do and what actually ships. I close that gap.
